# Predicting-IMBD-Movie-Ratings
The goal is to harness current IMDb data to create robust models for IMDb score prediction, which can benefit moviegoers and the film industry

# Objective
IMDb is a popular platform for storing information on movies, TV shows, Awards and events, and celebrities, making it a go-to source for movie enthusiasts. People often rely on IMDb to access essential information, such as movie ratings, to decide whether a film is worth watching. However, the challenge arises when newly released movies only have limited ratings, which can fluctuate over time. Our project focuses on constructing predictive models for IMDb scores to provide valuable insights into the potential of new movies. The goal is to harness current IMDb data to create robust models for IMDb score prediction, which can benefit moviegoers and the film industry.

# Data Acquistion
Data from about 2,000 movies on IMDb. For each movie, we have information on the following

# Steps taken to build the models
* Data Exploration
* Data Preparation
* Modelling
* Model Evaluation
* Model Selection
* Model Fine-Tuning

# Results and Insights
Some key questions answered:
* Insights into how budget allocation and marketing efforts, such as news articles and movie posters, correlate with IMDb score predictions
* Does various predicting factors which has been chosen initially really affect the IMDB Rating? What are the predicting variables actually affecting the IMDB Rating?
